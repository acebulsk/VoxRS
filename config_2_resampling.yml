# DATA INPUT PARAMETERS
config_id: 'test_19_052' # (str) - unique identifier for this configuration, used for voxel space identification (use same in config 1)
working_dir: '/media/alex/phd-data/cob-thesis/alex-example-processing/test1' # (str) - working directory for intermediate and output files (use same in config 1)
runtag: ''  # (str) - to be incorporated in output file names to destinguish between different runs. Blank string is fine.

# VOLUMETRIC RESAMPLING PARAMETERS
resample_las: False   # (bool) - Do you want to generate a resampled point cloud? (if False, subsequent parameters are ignored)
samps_per_vox: 50  # (int) volumetric resample rate [samples per voxel]
sample_threshold: 0  # (int) noise filter will drop all returns from voxels where total returns <= sample_threshold

# GRID RESAMPLING PARAMETERS
resample_grid: False # (bool) - Do you want to resample at a fixed angle across a grid? (if False, subsequent parameters are ignored)
dem_in: '/media/alex/phd-data/cob-thesis/lidar/data/lidar/19_052/19_052_las_proc/OUTPUT_FILES/DEM/19_052_dem_r.05m.tif' # (str) complete path to raster (geotif) file with coordinates and elevations at which to calculate hemispheres, masked to points of interest
phi: 0  # zenith angle of ray, calculated at each point (degrees). Can be a single value or a YAML list.
theta: 0  # azimuth angle of ray, calculated at each point (degrees clockwise from north, from above looking down). Can be a single value or a YAML list (same length as phi)
# HEMISPHERE RESAMPLING PARAMETERS
resample_hemi: True # (bool) - Do you want to generate synthetic hemispheres? (if False, subsequent parameters are ignored)
pts_in: '/media/alex/phd-data/cob-thesis/alex-example-processing/hemi_pts_ac.csv'  # (str) complete path to .csv file with coordinates and elevations at which to calculate hemispheres
            # pts file must include the following header labels: id, easting_m, northing_m, elev_m
img_size: 181  # angular resolution ~ # of samples across 180 deg
max_phi_deg: 90  # (num) maximum zenith angle to sample [deg] (90 deg samples to horizon)
hemi_m_above_ground: 0  # height [m] above ground points (pts_in) at which to generate hemispheres
tile_count_1d: 1  # (int) number of square tiles along one side (total # of tiles = tile_count_1d^2)
n_cores: 1  # (int) number of processing cores

# GENERAL RESAMPLING PARAMETERS (for all types of resampling)
max_distance: 50  # maximum distance [m] to sample ray (balance computation time with accuracy at distance)
min_distance: 0  # minimum distance [m] to sample ray (default 0, increase to avoid "lens occlusion" within dense voxels)
